## Problem Statements & Key Insights ##
**ðŸ“Œ 1. Who should Amazon recommend more products to?**
Amazon aims to enhance personalized recommendations, but whom should it target?
- **Key Insight:** Users with a higher conversion rateâ€”those who frequently complete purchasesâ€”are more likely to receive recommendations.
- **Conversion Rate Definition in Amazonâ€™s Context:**
- The ratio of completed purchases to total product views indicates how effectively a customer moves from browsing to buying.
- A higher conversion rate suggests an engaged buyer, making them ideal for targeted recommendations.

**ðŸ“Œ 2. Which products have the highest number of reviews?**
Products with more reviews often indicate higher sales and popularity within Amazonâ€™s marketplace.
- **Key Insight:** Frequently sold products naturally accumulate more reviews over time.
- Products with high engagement (frequent purchases and reviews) provide valuable feedback for improving recommendations and inventory planning.

**ðŸ“Œ 3. Do frequent viewers behave differently from non-frequent viewers?**
Customer behavior can vary based on purchase frequency, but how different are frequent vs. non-frequent viewers?
- Frequent Viewers: Customers who have purchased a particular product 50 times or more.
- Non-Frequent Viewers: Customers with less than 50 purchases of the same product.
- **Key Insights:**
- Frequent viewers exhibit stronger loyalty and tend to stick to familiar brands/products.
- Non-frequent viewers might explore more options before purchasing.
- **Sentiment Analysis** may reveal whether frequent buyers have more positive experiences than occasional buyers.

**ðŸ“Œ 4. Are frequent users more verbose?**
Do frequent buyers write longer, more detailed reviews, or do they keep feedback short?
- **Key Insight:** Customers who engage more tend to leave detailed reviews, helping future buyers make informed choices.
- **Box Plot Explanation:**
- A box plot helps visualize review length distribution, distinguishing frequent vs. non-frequent reviewers.
- It highlights outliers (extremely long reviews), median review lengths, and variance in feedback styles.

**ðŸ“Œ 5. Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews**
Customer feedback plays a crucial role in understanding experiences and refining recommendations.
- **Key Insight:** Sentiment polarity scores help categorize reviews as positive, neutral, or negative.
- **Polarity Score Ranges:**
- +1 â†’ Highly positive sentiment (e.g., "Amazing product! Highly recommended!")
-  0 â†’ Neutral sentiment (e.g., "Product is okay, nothing special.")
- -1 â†’ Negative sentiment (e.g., "Worst experience ever, do not buy!")
